     * This way, files created in mounted volumes (temp dir, workspace dir) are owned by a container's user
     * which by default is root (uid = 0, guid = 0). For a development it can cause troubles, so default setting
     * is call docker run with uid and gid of the current user.

     * don't map permissions to host files directly, they will be accessible by a current user anyway
